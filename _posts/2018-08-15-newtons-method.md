In numerical analysis, [Newton's method](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) (also known as the Newton–Raphson method), named after Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, is a method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. It is one example of a root-finding algorithm.
