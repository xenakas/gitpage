'Artificial' neural network (ANN), is a computing system made up of a number of simple, highly 
interconnected processing elements, which process information by their dynamic state response 
to external inputs. 

ANNs are processing devices (algorithms or actual hardware) that are loosely modeled 
after the neuronal structure of the mamalian cerebral cortex but on much smaller scales.
A large ANN might have hundreds or thousands of processor units, whereas a mamalian brain has billions
of neurons with a corresponding increase in magnitude of their overall interaction and emergent behavior. Although ANN researchers are generally not concerned with whether their networks accurately resemble 
biological systems, some have.
