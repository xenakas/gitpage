Below is a list most interesting data sources I’ve come across: 

[Big Data: 33 Brilliant And Free Data Sources Anyone Can Use](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/12/big-data-35-brilliant-and-free-data-sources-for-2016/amp/)

[Awesome Public Datasets – GitHub](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)

<div class="message">
The most popular NoSQL database is Apache Cassandra. Cassandra, which was once Facebook proprietary 
 database, was released as open source in 2008. Other NoSQL implementa- tions include SimpleDB, 
Google BigTable, Apache Hadoop, MapReduce, MemcacheDB, and Voldemort. Companies that use NoSQL include Twitter, LinkedIn and NetFlix.

Publicly Accessible APIs:
- Reddit
- tumblr
- Wikipedia

[NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=berkeley&s=all&id=110635), 
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)

University websites (Berkeley has lots of data)

Difficult sources of data, mostly because of restrictive APIs / anti-scraping policies:
- LinkedIn
- Facebook
- Yelp
- Foursquare
- Craigslist
